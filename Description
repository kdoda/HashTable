Creating HashTable class by defining all the functions necessary.
It is used quadratic probing.

The functions and are implemented to improve this case:

Since it is a quadratic probing the table size needs to be a prime number and the table should be at max half full.When the table its 
excatly half full and the user enters another value the vector need to be resized,all the previous elements should be copied(which if
the vector is large it takes a long time,and it is bothering for the user)  and then 
insertthe next value.I modified to functions to improve this case in this way:
When the vector is excatly half full every time the user enters a value,a fixed number of elements will be copied form the first table
thus continuing in this way until the whole first array is copied.In this way the user would not notice the delay.
